# Project Title
Final Project Part Two - Testing with API

In this project we are testing LinkedIn website by using API requests, and we interact with the response to assert 
that we are getting the results that we are looking for.
The code is structured in three layers (infra, logic, test) using OOP in Python with documentation and logging.

## What To Install
PyCharm
unittest package
requests package
logging package

## How To Operate
In the layers of  automation testing, the user only operate in the running tests layer in the folder called "test".
by opening the folder of "api" in folder "test" you will see three files of python, by double pressing on 
one of the files it will open on the main screen.
The tester can run each test in the file individually by press on run logo left of the same function of the class.
The tester can also run all tests one after the other in one click by pressing run logo left of the main class. 
or press on run logo on the whole page.
The expected result is "OK" in red. that means the test passed successfully.
If you face a result other than "OK" please approach the coder for clarification!
