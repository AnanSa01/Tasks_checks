#Hello Tzahi, I want to tell you that in this version every code written here is by me, in Python and HTML,
#I learned in the holiday basic HTML for a couple of hours, and all the main, classes and html pages I searched for it
#and wrote it with understanding each line. and wrote some functions by myself and one of them ...
#...actually worked in the first try.

#I wrote the functions from the bottom upwards, meaning after I finished working on each function the next one I added..
#.. it above the previous one.

#I thought of other functions to add but I didn't have the time to work on it because of Eid al-Adha feast and also ...
#... because we need to work on the QA project for next week
